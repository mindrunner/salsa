//! Every slot, there are two stages: delegation and fallback.
//! During delegation stage, the block scheduler awaits a whole block.
//! If a whole block is received by the end of the stage, it is scheduled.
//! Otherwise, vanilla scheduling takes over during fallback stage.
//!
//! The state is stored in a single atomic u64:
//! - Bit 63: 1 = claimed by block, 0 = claimed by vanilla
//! - Bit 62: 1 = block is actively executing a message (blocks votes)
//! - Lower 62 bits: slot number
//! - Sentinel value (u64::MAX) indicates no slot has been scheduled yet
